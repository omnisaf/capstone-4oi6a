# Citation bank

Answers [#7](https://github.com/omnisaf/capstone-4oi6a/issues/7): which papers and standards each part of the project should cite.

**How this was checked (2026-09-24).** Every entry below was confirmed to exist.
Anything with a DOI was checked against the Crossref registry (title, authors,
venue, year, pages). Conference papers without a DOI were checked on the ISMIR
or DAFx proceedings archive. Standards were checked on the publisher's own site
(ESTA TSP, ITU, W3C). Nothing here is from memory alone. If you add a source,
check it the same way.

**How to use it.** Numbers run [1]–[36] in one list, so you can paste straight
into the report's reference section and renumber in citation order. Each entry
has one line on what it gives us and one line on where it gets cited.

> Standards note: DMX512-A and sACN both had new editions recently.
> Cite **E1.11-2024** and **E1.31-2025**, not the older 2008 / 2018 editions.
> Same for photosensitivity: **ITU-R BT.1702-3 (2023)** is the one in force.
